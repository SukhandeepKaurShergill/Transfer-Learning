# Transfer-Learning and GANs
# **Pre-trained Models**

- These models are trained on large dataset i.e. imagenet dataset.
- With limited data and power we can use these models to train our model.
- We will conisder three trained models:
    - Vgg16
    - ResNet50
    - Inception V3
#** GANS**
- Two types of GAN model will be trained
    -Simple GAN for MNIST dataset
    -Conditional GAN for fashionNIST dataset

### **3. Dataset for transfer learning**
---
-A google drive link has been shared with you, it includes all the training data and trained model.
-For dataset of dog_breed classification:
    -Go to Thapar_summer_school folder 
    -in side it Go to dog_breed_vgg16 folder
    -it includes train folder and labels.csv file (Train folder includes 
    -Kindly download it and put these folders on your google drive (it will take time and space, Kindly keep free some space in your drive for it)
