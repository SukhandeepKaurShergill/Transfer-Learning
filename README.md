# Transfer-Learning and GANs
# **Pre-trained Models**

- These models are trained on large dataset i.e. imagenet dataset.
- With limited data and power we can use these models to train our model.
- We will conisder three trained models:
    - Vgg16
    - ResNet50
    - Inception V3
#** GANS**
- Two types of GAN model will be trained
    -Simple GAN for MNIST dataset
    -Conditional GAN for fashionNIST dataset
